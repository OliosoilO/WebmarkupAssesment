		    <h3>Solar Panels</h3>
		    <p>
			    Solar panels are made out of photovoltaic cells 
				that convert the sun’s energy into electricity.
				Photovoltaic cells are sandwiched between layers of 
				semi-conducting materials such as silicone. 
				Each layer has different electronic properties that 
				energise when hit by photons from sunlight, 
				creating an electric field. 
				and it’s this that creates the current needed 
				to produce electricity. Solar panels generate a direct 
				current of electricity. This is then passed through 
				an inverter , which can then be funnelled into the National Grid or 
				used by the home or business the solar panels are attached to.

		<h3>Charge Controller</h3>
		    <p>
			    A charge controller, charge regulator or battery regulator 
				limits the rate at which electric current is added to or 
				drawn from electric batteries. It prevents overcharging 
				and may protect against overvoltage, which can reduce battery performance 
				or lifespan and may pose a safety risk. It may also prevent completely draining 
				a battery, or perform controlled discharges, depending on the battery technology, 
				to protect battery life.

		<h3>Battery System</h3>
		    <p>
			    Solar batteries work by storing energy produced by your solar panels 
				for later use. In some cases, solar batteries have their own inverter 
				and offer integrated energy conversion. The higher your battery's capacity, 
				the more solar energy it can store.

		<h3>DC Power</h3>
		    <p>
			     Direct current (DC) electricity is what solar panels produce and what 
				 batteries hold in storage, while alternating current (AC) electricity 
				 is the type used on the grid and in most household devices. 
				 A device called an inverter is required to convert the DC electricity 
				 from solar panels into appliance-friendly AC.

		<h3>Inverter</h3>
		     <p>
			    A solar inverter or PV inverter, is a type of electrical converter 
				which converts the variable direct current (DC) output of a 
				photovoltaic (PV) solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current (AC) 
				that can be fed into a commercial electrical grid or used by a local, 
				off-grid electrical network.

			    alternating current (AC) electricity is the type used on the grid and in 
				most household devices. A device called an inverter is required to convert 
				the DC electricity from solar panels into appliance-friendly AC.
